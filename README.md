## NOTICE

This is the repository of Team 10022's code for the 2023-24 FTC season.

## Welcome!
IT TOOK ME WAY TOO MUCH TIME MAKING THIS.

## Requirements
Android Studio or onBotJava

## Getting Started
All right, I will make it short because I don't want to write a whole changelog. This is WiredCats Gen3 2023-24 code for FTC season and it was awesome.
This project has been a dream come true but a story with a tragic end. It has TeleOp and Timed Auto because Encoders never managed to work D:
Anyways the most useful stuff is on the TwoPlayersTeleOp and has some methods that process the commands for specific parts of the robot.
I might have forgotten to comment on Timed Auto but that's fine. 

In auto, the names are :
* Auto CL= close left. Make robot look towards the board
* Auto CR = close right. Make robot look towards the board
* Auto FL = Far Left. Make robot look towards the board
* Auto FR = Far Right. Make robot look towards the board
* Auto PixelCR = from close right, tries to put a pixel on board (put the robot with claw opposite the board)
* Auto Pixel CL = is that real? I forgot.

## Good Luck!
yeah, well. good luck with my code.
